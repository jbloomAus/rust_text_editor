# HECTO

I'm continuing to learn rust. This time by building a basic text editor based on this tutorial: https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-chapter-4/

## Current progress:

I'm currently up to chapter 4. 

I'm not sure the cursor positioning is working as intended (appears only to go left/right and not up/down). I'm inferring this from tilda movement too, not from the apparent cursor location. These differences/issues might be more obvious as time goes so instead of fixing immediately, I'll start the next chapter and see if the reason elucidates itself.
