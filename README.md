# HECTO

I'm continuing to learn rust. This time by building a basic text editor based on this tutorial: https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-chapter-4/

## Current progress:

I'm currently part of the way through chapter 4. 

We've implemented scrolling which demonstrated that what I thought might have been a bug was not. The cursor's position isn't obvious but it is repsonding to up and down keys.
